## Health/Fitness App

This web application utilizes React and Firebase to give users an intuitive place to track their health/fitness. 

This web application is meant to allow users to track their personal health info. User's may create an account where they are able to personalize their info, and see how many calories they are eating within their allowance.

The Exercise Tracker allows users to utilize the Nutritionix API to input Natural Language to track their exercises and visualize calories burnt. Inputs such as "I ran for half an hour and boxed for 30 minutes" and "I climbed stairs for an hour" can be read and tracked.
